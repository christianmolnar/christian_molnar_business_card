                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>Throughout my career, Monitoring, Telemetry, and Observability---and their core objective of building lightning-fast, reliable, self-monitoring, and self-remediating platforms---have always risen to the top, either as non-negotiables or core deliverables.</p>
                    <p>Starting and leading MSN Performance & Reliability Engineering taught me my most valuable lesson: great features delight customers, but failure in fundamentals kills business impact in the blink of an eye.</p>
                    <p>I bring a proven record of building and scaling high-performance, highly available, self-monitoring, and self-remediating systems at global scale, with deep hands-on experience in performance engineering, monitoring, incident response, and operational excellence.</p>
                    <p>I thrive parachuting into complex problems, aligning teams, and driving measurable results through data-driven decision making and a relentless focus on customer needs.</p>
