                <h2>KEY ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
                <div class="achievements-cols with-divider">
                    <ul>
                        <li>At Microsoft, I built the Modern Release Orchestration Experiences (MROUI), which sped up MS Office release cadence to monthly, contributing to 2x MS Office seat growth: 11/2015=60MM -> 11/2017=120MM.</li>
                        <li>Built <a href="https://status.cloud.microsoft" target="_blank">https://status.cloud.microsoft</a> with 99.99% uptime, a cross-cloud Status solution for all of Microsoft.</li>
                        <li>Leading Change, Incident Comms, and Co-Pilot Health for the M365 Admin Center, I booted up 2 teams in Dublin, Ireland, powering global M365, Azure, and Security Roadmap communications.</li>
                        <li>At MSN.com: I eliminated MSN.com outages with the patented <a href="https://staticview.msn.com/en-us/" target="_blank">MSN Static Page</a>. Clicking this link will take you to the actual page, stripped of dynamic elements, that a user would be served in case of a catastrophic outage.  For a bit more fun, replace the 'en-us' for 'fr-fr' or 'de-de'. </li>
                        <li>I improved MSN.com page load times from >10 seconds to <1 second, increasing daily Page Views by 16.5%, from 110MM to 130MM daily unique users. I invented Ad Impact Testing (patented), transforming Ad quality, ensuring only high-performing ads ran on MSN.com, ending rogue Ads that killed engagement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="divider"></div>

                        <li>Architected and built Bing Elections 2012 in a record 4 months, scaling to 200M page views on Election Day with just 20 web servers.</li>
                        <li>Led Dev/Test for iShipâ€™s CMS (Counter Manifest System) for 35% shipping cost reduction, acquired by UPS, deployed at corporate campuses nationwide and at over 4,500 The UPS Store locations today.</li>
