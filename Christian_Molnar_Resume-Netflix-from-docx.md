## Professional Summary

Throughout my career, Monitoring, Telemetry, and Observability---and
their core objective of building lightning-fast, reliable,
self-monitoring, and self-remediating platforms---have always risen to
the top, either as non-negotiables or core deliverables.

Starting and leading MSN Performance & Reliability Engineering taught me
my most valuable lesson: great features delight customers, but failure
in fundamentals kills business impact in the blink of an eye.

I bring a proven record of building and scaling high-performance, highly
available, self-monitoring, and self-remediating systems at global
scale, with deep hands-on experience in performance engineering,
monitoring, incident response, and operational excellence.

I thrive parachuting into complex problems, aligning teams, and driving
measurable results through data-driven decision making and a relentless
focus on customer needs.
